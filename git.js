touch for new file inside a folder

The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
 It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next 
 commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any 
significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .


git add prepares files for commit

vi nameofFile to write in file

cat nameofFile for viewing what you have written

If you didn't make any changes, press ßesc + type :q and press Enter / return. 
If you made some changes and would like to keep them, type :wq and 
press Enter / return. If you made 
some changes and would rather discard them, type :q! and press Enter / return.



git reset idcode    , this will remove all the commits above that  idCode



Use git stash when you want to record the current state of 
the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a 
clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications 
away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.



 In vim, you can press i to start entering text and 
 save by pressing esc and :wq and enter , 
 this will commit with the message you typed
